Initially I only used one convolutional and pooling layer. The result was not accurate at all, it was around 5%. 
I added another layer of convolutional and pooling. This improved the program and the result was more than 94%.
After this I added the 3rd convolutional and pooling layers. This provided a result of 85% of accuracy.
I increased the Dense to 256, the result was 93%
The dropout was reduced to 0.3 and the result was 95.72% Since this is better than the example task I consider this a great result.
